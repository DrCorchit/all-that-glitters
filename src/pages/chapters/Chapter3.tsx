				This section is found in the topmost left section of the character sheet, and records the most basic information about your character,
				including their name, combat class, level, race, and alignment. Races, classes, and alignments are discussed in more detail in the
				<ChapterLink chapter={2} rel='prev'>

function StatsSection(): JSX.Element {

		<Section name={info.sections[1]}>
			<p>Found in the topmost right corner, this section tracks several important statistics:</p>
			<h5>Hitpoints</h5>
			<p>
				Hitpoints (HP) measure hardiness and vitality. When a creature's hitpoints fall to zero, they succumb to their wounds and fall unconscious. A
				character’s maximum HP is initially equal to their strength score and increases each level by one half their strength score. The base value
				can be bolstered by other effects such as class feature, feats, or magical gear.
			</p>
			<pre>{strings.max_hp_formula}</pre>
			<h5>Willpower</h5>
			<p>
				Willpower (WP) is expended as the player uses powerful spells and abilities. When WP is fully depleted, the character is said to be exhausted.
				There is not an immediate penalty for this condition, other than not being able to use critically important abilities. Maximum willpower is
				equal to 10 plus a player's <Sub attr='CHA' /> and <Sub attr='NST' />
				modifiers.
			</p>
			<pre>{strings.max_wp_formula}</pre>
			<h5>Mitigation</h5>
			<p>
				Mitigation (MIT) is a derived statistic which determines how likely a character is to successfully avoid damage from an attack, similar to
				armor class from D&amp;D. During combat, melee and ranged attacks are treated as an event roll testing the martial arts or accuracy skill of
				the attacking player. Mitigation provides the difficulty threshold that determines whether the attack succeeds. Thus, players with high
				mitigation are hit less often and survive longer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mitigation is composed of two values: dodge chance (DC) and block chance (BC). Dodge chance is initially equal to the player’s dexterity
				attribute, while block chance is determined by the character’s shields and armor. The two values are added together to calculate total
				mitigation. Note that DC is reduced after every attack by the attacker's
				<Sub attr='DEX' /> modifier, whether the attack is successful or not. Dodge chance is also reduced to zero (for both characters) when a
				character is grappled.
			</p>
			<p>DC, BC, and MIT are calculated as follows:</p>
			<pre>{strings.dc_formula}</pre>
			<pre>{strings.bc_formula}</pre>
			<pre>{strings.mit_formula}</pre>
			<p style={{marginLeft: "25px"}}>
				Note: The character sheet is meant to record the base mitigation statistic. Temporary or conditional bonuses (such as from potions, spells, or
				parrying) should not be recorded here.
			</p>
			<p>
				To calculate effective MIT against an attack, add any circumstantial bonuses or penalties to BC and DC to the base mitigation value. For
				example, specific potions increase DC, while the parry reaction or certain spells improve BC.
			</p>
			<h5>Gold</h5>
			<p>
				Gold measures a character's material wealth, and does not necessarily correspond to a specific number of gold coins or any specific currency.
				Coins made from other metals such as copper or silver are converted to their gold value when recorded on the character sheet. Gold is mainly
				used to purchase goods and services, such as buying equipment from merchants or hiring trainers.
			</p>
			<h5>Status</h5>
			<p>This section records any status effects inflicted on your character.</p>
			<h5>Training Slots</h5>
			<p>
				Training slots are a resource that control how often a character can learn new abilities from training. Characters expend training slots
				whenever they learn new feats or spells. If they don't have enough training slots for a new ability, they may have to forget an ability to
				regain the required training slots, or wait until they level up. If you're just making a character, you won't have used any training slots, so
				they will be at maximum, which is equal to your intelligence attribute score. Training slots are explained in more detail in{" "}
				<ChapterLink chapter={6} />.
			</p>
			<pre>{strings.training_slots_formula}</pre>

function AttrsSection(): JSX.Element {
	return (
		<Section name={info.sections[2]}>
			<p>
				The six attributes, <i>Strength</i>, <i>Dexterity</i>, <i>Speed</i>, <i>Intelligence</i>, <i>Instinct</i>, and <i>Charisma</i>, describe the
				raw physical and mental capabilities of a character. Each attribute has a value typically from 0 to 20, with a score of 0 indicating a total
				absence of the attribute (as with someone who is dead or unconscious) while a score of 20 indicating a nearly superhuman level of aptitude.
				For humans, a score of ten indicates an average level of proficiency.
			</p>
			<p style={{marginLeft: "25px"}} id='modifier'>
				Note: In some situations, we do not use the attribute score directly, but the <i>modifier</i>. The modifier for an attribute is obtained by
				subtracting 10 from the attribute score. An average human with 10 for all attribute scores would thus have 0 for their modifiers.
			</p>
			<Table
				headers={["Attribute Name", "Abbreviation", "What it Measures", "GameplayEffects", "Real-life Equivalence"]}
				data={attributes.array}
				mapper={attr => [attr.name, attr.abbr, attr.description, attr.effects.join(", "), attr.interpretation ?? ""]}
			/>
			<p>
				Each attribute affects multiple aspects of gameplay, meaning that players should care about which stats they prioritize and which they
				neglect. Not every character needs to be well-rounded, but characters with unusual ability score distributions should feel somewhat unbalanced
				to play.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're filling out your character sheet for the first time, your attributes are going to be determined by your racial and class bonuses. Go
				ahead and add up the totals and record them onto your character sheet, then move to the next section. Your attribute scores will increase
				later on as you level up.
			</p>
		</Section>
	);
}

function EquipmentSection(): JSX.Element {
	return (
		<Section name={info.sections[3]}>
			<p>
				This section records your character's equipped weapons and armor. Magical trinkets are not recorded here, but under "inventory", even if they
				are currently being worn.
			</p>
			<h5>Weapons</h5>
			<p>
				To fill out this section, copy down the names and damage of the weapons you chose when you created your character. For example, let's suppose
				you're playing a character with a strength score of 13 and a dexterity score of 15. If you chose a longsword, you would write:
			</p>
			<pre>Longsword 1d12+3</pre>
			<p>
				The 1d12 is the die used by the weapon, while the +3 comes from your strength, because the longsword is a strength weapon. On the other hand,
				if you chose a katana, you would enter:
			</p>
			<pre>Katana 1d8+5</pre>
			<p>
				Since the katana is a nimble weapon, you want to use whichever is higher of strength and dexterity for damage. Since 15 is higher than 13, you
				would use dexterity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, write down whichever modifiers apply to that weapon. You can refer to <AppendixLink appendix={3} /> for more information on weapons
				and modifiers. If you're fully familiar with your weapon's modifiers, I suggest using this space to record the abilities of any magical
				weapons you equip.
			</p>
			<p>A player can carry up to two weapons, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A single two-handed weapon</li>
				<li>A one-handed weapon, plus a buckler, shield, or small weapon in the offhand</li>
				<li>Two light weapons, such as two shortswords or two daggers</li>
				<li>A light weapon and a greatshield</li>
				<li>A one-handed weapon, with the offhand kept free to cast spells</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you only carry one weapon, leave the "offhand" column blank.</p>
			<h5>Armor</h5>
			<p>
				Under the "armor" section, write down the type of armor your character is wearing and the associated BC. For example, if your character is a
				knight you would start out wearing half plate. Therefore, you would write:
			</p>
			<pre>Name: Half Plate BC: 12</pre>
			<p>
				If you don't know the BC of your armor, you can look it up in <AppendixLink appendix={4} />
			</p>
		</Section>
	);
}

function SkillsSection(): JSX.Element {
	return (
		<Section name={info.sections[4]}>
			<p>
				Skills are related to attributes in that they are also used for event rolls. Every skill has an underlying supporting attribute, whose
				modifier is added to the roll as with an attribute check. In addition to this, players add a bonus from training called a proficiency bonus.
				The final value of the skill check equals the number rolled on the d20 plus the attribute modifier plus the proficency bonus, as follows:
			</p>
			<pre>{strings.skill_check_formula}</pre>
			<p>
				Although every skill depends on at least one attribute, several skills have a secondary supporting attribute whose modifier may be used
				instead, under certain circumstances. For example, a player who is sneaking may decide that they are too clumsy to move quietly and instead
				opt to sprint past the guard while his gaze is turned. In this case, the player is trying to use their modifier for speed instead of dexterity
				for the stealth check. Whether this type of substitution is allowed is situational. Certain circumstances may <i>require</i> that the
				alternative attribute score modifier is used, while others may allow the player to choose whichever is higher.
			</p>
			<p>
				When filling out this section, copy the <Link to={{hash: "modifier"}}>modifier</Link> of the relevant attribute under the column labeled
				"base". Then, record your proficiency bonus (if any) under "bonus". Add the two together to calculate your total bonus for that skill. For
				example, if your character has a dexterity score of 13 and proficiency in
				<Sub skill='accuracy' />, you would fill out the entry for the accuracy skill as follows:
			</p>
			<pre>Base + Bonus = Total 3 + 2 = +5</pre>
			<p>Here is a list of all skills:</p>
			<table className='standard'>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Skill Name</th>
						<th>Supporting Attributes</th>
						<th>What it Measures</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					{skills.array.map((skill, index) => (
						<SkillElement skill={skill} key={index} />
					))}
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>There are five levels of proficiency in each skill. Each proficiency level has a corresponding bonus, as follows:</p>
			<table className='standard'>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Level</th>
						<th>Roll Bonus</th>
						<th>Effects</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Deficient</td>
						<td>-2</td>
						<td>Rolling a 2 or 3 counts as a critical failure.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>None</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Proficient</td>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>Can expend 5 willpower to roll with advantage.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Expert</td>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>Can expend 4 willpower to roll with advantage.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Mastery</td>
						<td>6</td>
						<td>Can expend 3 willpower to roll with advantage. Can reroll a natural 1 once per skill check.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>
				Each of these labels indicate that the player has either undertaken training or has an especial weakness in that skill. Deficiencies can be
				overcome and expertise and mastery can be attained through training even after a character is made.
			</p>
			<p>
				When players obtain proficiency bonuses to the same skill from multiple sources, they do not combine to advance one’s proficiency in that
				skill to the next level. However, if a player acquires proficiency for the same skill from both their race and class, they may take
				proficiency in a new skill to replace the doubled proficiency.

			<p>
				Now that we've covered the various components of the character sheet, let's walk through the process of creating a character and filling out
				the sheet. Let's create a character named "Arnoch Strontorius":
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				{" "}
				Arnoch is a wizard, preferring to explore the application of arcane energy outside the auspices of university. He comes from a long line of
				adventurers, all the way back to his thrice-great grandfather, Sapio Strontorius. Back in the day, Sapio made a name for himself as a
				mercenary who wielded his hand-and-a-half sword and elemental magic with equal finesse. Although Arnoch has a lot to live up to, he's already
				shown himself as a magical prodigy. A string of family anecdotes recount his abilities, including a time when he burnt down an entire outhouse
				and several trees at the wee age of three, despite not having any formal training in pyromancy. Arnoch has always been enamored with flames,
				and fireball is his favorite spell. He says his favorite sound is the silence that comes just before a fireball (usually hurled by Arnoch
				himself) strikes and explodes, although the sound of dry tinder bursting into flame is a close second. His family has always encouraged him to
				develop his talents, and are very excited to send their little pyromaniac off on his first adventure.
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				Although Arnoch's got a bit of elven ancestry from way back when, he's mainly just an old-fashioned, home-grown human raised on the family
				farm. (Meaning the true source of his powers remains a mystery.) Arnoch has a strong moral compass, but little regard for the law, making him
				unpredictable and threat to corrupt politicians. As Arnoch sets out to find his fortune, he little guesses just what he's heading into... or
				that he is already being watched, on account of his extraordinary powers.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Now that we've established Arnoch's background, let's fill in his character sheet. First we write "Arnoch Strontorius" in the info section,
				followed by "wizard" as his class and "1" as his level. Below this, we write "human" and "CG" or "Chaotic Good" as his alignment.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the next section, we need Arnoch's attributes. As a human, we can choose to improve two of Arnoch's attributes by 1, by decreasing two
				others by 1. We'll increase his <Sub attr='INT' /> and <Sub attr='CHA' />, at the cost of his <Sub attr='SPD' />
				and <Sub attr='STR' />. As a wizard, he gains +2 to <Sub attr='INT' /> and <Sub attr='CHA' />. Adding these together, Arnoch's attributes are
				as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>STR</b>: 9
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>DEX</b>: 10
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>SPD</b>: 9
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>INT</b>: 13
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>NST</b>: 10
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>CHA</b>: 13
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We can now go ahead and enter these values under "Attributes", and then move on to the statistics section. At level 1, max HP is equal to
				Strength, so we enter "9" as his max HP. Arnoch's <Sub attr='NST' /> modifier is +0 and his
				<Sub attr='CHA' /> modifier is +3. We add these together and then add 10 to calculate his max willpower of 13. Finally, his intelligence of 13
				means that he has 13 training slots. Since he hasn't learned any new abilities yet, his training slots are at maximum.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now let's calculate his mitigation stat. He's wearing sorcerer's robes, so his block chance is zero. Meanwhile, his dexterity is 10, which is
				his dodge chance. For his mitigation stat, we write:
			</p>
			<pre>Block + Dodge = Mitigation 0 + 10 = 10</pre>
			<p>The next sections are abilities, backstory, and equipment.</p>
