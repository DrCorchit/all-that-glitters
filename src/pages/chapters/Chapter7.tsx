				In order to learn a spell, a player must usually find a spellbook, scroll, or trainer who has knowledge of that
				specific spell. These would normally be found in larger towns and cities, or rarely in dungeons or out in the
				wilderness. Certain spells are so widespread that they are considered common knowledge and can be learned
				without a tome. Likewise, certain class abilities such as the Witch's eldritch tome or the scholar's codex
				arcana provide special access to arcane knowledge.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once an appropriate trainer or tome has been located, the player may have to meet certain requirements, such as:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A certain adventurer level</li>
				<li>A certain level of an attribute</li>
				<li>Proficiency in a certain skill</li>
				<li>Mastery of prerequisite spells</li>
				<li>A certain number of training slots</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Each spell lists its specific requirements in its description. Once all these requirements are met, the player
				learns the spell. The spell can only be unlearned if the player intentionally forgets it, usually in order to
				free up training slots.
			</p>
			<h5>Spell Rarities</h5>
			<p>
				Some spells are much more commonly used and studied than others. Spells come in four rarities, which determine
				how difficult it is to acquire knowledge, as well as how others (such as NPCs) would likely react to seeing them
				used.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Common</b> spells are widely known and often used for very practical applications such as healing or
					repair. These spells are usually watered-down versions of more powerful spells studied by academic
					institutions.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Scholarly</b> spells are studied and taught at a university level. They are generally inaccessible to the
					population at large, usually due to the high precision and innate talent required to cast correctly.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Esoteric</b> spells are not taught by universities, even at a doctoral level. Learning of the existence of
					such a spell (let alone learning its practice) usually requires supernatural assistance.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Forbidden</b> spells are not taught by universities, even at a doctoral level, for reasons other than
					legality. Some of these spells have been lost to time, while others are studied in secret by druids or
					cultists. The easiest way to learn esoteric spells is via supernatural assistance.

				Once a spell has been learned, certain additional requirements must be met in order to cast the spell. These
				requirements are unique to each spell, and detailed in the spell description. In general, most spells expend AP
				and require a main hand action to cast. However, some spells require two hands, while others can be cast with
				the offhand. Spell requirements are often related to how the spell is cast, as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Evocation spells</b>: These are spells of the ordinary sort, which are cast quickly and take effect
					instantaneously. So named because they often initiated by speaking a magical word. Casting the spell incurs a
					one-time expenditure of AP. Most of these are versatile spells with few material or circumstantial
					requirements.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Concentration Spells</b>: Spells which are cast over a span of time. These spells usually require a burst
					of AP to initiate the spell and a smaller amount to maintain it. Concentration can be broken if the caster is
					damaged or distracted.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rituals</b>: Spells that require careful and methodic preparation. These spells are not normally cast
					during combat, but usually offer a better tradeoff of AP versus power. Rituals often require specific
					circumstances, such as certain weather conditions, positioning of the moon or stars, or access to a
					consecrated altar.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Ceremonies</b>: Ceremonies are complex rituals that require more magical energy than is available to a
					single character. During a ceremony, each participant contributes some energy towards the casting of the
					spell. Like rituals, these spells often have special requirements.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Enchantments</b>: An enchantment is a special type of ritual spell where the magic is infused into a
					physical object or substance, such as a sword, piece of armor, or an alchemical brew. The enchantment's magic
					lingers long after the spell is cast.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Targeting Spells</h5>
			<p>
				Many spells have a range of effectiveness and target a certain area of the battlefield. Every spell has a
				target, of one of the following types:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Self</b>: The spell targets the caster of the spell only.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Touch</b>: The spell targets one or more creatures that the spellcaster is able to physically touch.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Range</b>: The spell affects some or all targets of a specific type within a given range.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Shape</b>: The spell targets a specific area within range, based on one of the shapes described below. If
					the range is zero, the shape is targeted on the caster.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Most spells that target something within a range require line-of-sight to the target. A spell can be cast on a
				target without line-of-sight only if the description explicitly says so. The caster always has line-of-sight to
				themselves.
			</p>
			<p>Spells that target a shape use one of the following shapes:</p>
			<table className='default'>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Shape</th>
						<th>Effect</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Sphere</td>
						<td>Affects all targets which overlap a sphere. The sphere's radius is specified by the spell.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cylinder</td>
						<td>
							Affects all targets which overlap a vertical cylinder. The cylinder's radius and height are specified by
							the spell.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cone</td>
						<td>
							Affects all targets which overlap a horizontal cone, with the tip at the point of origination. The cone's
							length is specified by the spell. Its angle defaults to 45 if not specified.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Line</td>
						<td>
							Affects all targets in the path of the line. The length is specified by the spell. The width defaults to 1
							if not otherwise specified. If the spell target is self, then one of the line endpoints ends on the
							caster's tile. The caster decides if the spell includes their tile or not.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cube</td>
						<td>
							Affects all targets within a cube. The edge length of the cube is specified by the spell. The cube is
							centered on the point of origination if not otherwise specified.
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>

				Any sensible treatise on magic will disclose the following insight: <i>magic is energy</i>. Therefore, magic is
				classified according to whence this energy originates, the techniques used to manipulate it, and finally
				according to the overall purpose of its application. In fact, all spells follow the same basic pattern, whereby
				the magus identifies a source of energy, imposes order over chaos, and finally unleashes this directed energy
				upon the world.

			<p>
				Despite being intensely studied, magic remains an abstruse and opaque subject. Among those who study it, there
				is no consensus as to why certain individuals wield its power so effortlessly, why certain spells are so
				difficult to reproduce, and why other spells work at all. This inconvenience doesn't stop scholars from doing
				the one thing they are truly good at, however: categorizing things.
			</p>
			<p>
				A long time ago, spells were categorized into two types: thaumaturgy and divination. Thaumaturgical disciplines
				used the suffix -urgy, while divination schools used the suffix -mancy. For example, there was once a
				distinction between necromancy and necromurgy; the former was concerned with contacting deceased spirits, while
				the latter with raising their bodies. However, centuries of expanding magical theory as well as a good deal of
				linguistic bastardization have relegated such distinction to a mere footnote of history. Modern magic is divided
				into six schools of sorcery, which each have their own disciplines. These are listed below:
