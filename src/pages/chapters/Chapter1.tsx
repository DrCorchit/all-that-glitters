				All That Glitters, like any tabletop roleplaying system, has three parts: The players, the storyteller, and the rulebook. Each part has a
				duty:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						The players should understand the abilities of their characters and avoid cheating or metagaming. They should also respect everyone at the
						table and give the storyteller feedback so that problems don’t arise out of the blue.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The storyteller should create a compelling setting, characters, and story. They should create tension and introduce challenging combat
						encounters while also avoiding favoritism and respecting player agency.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The rulebook should provide a framework where players can reason about the outcome of their actions and see their characters progressing
						in potency. It should assist the storyteller in creating combat encounters that are both unique and appropriately difficult. It may also
						give the storyteller guidelines for expanding the game system.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In order to play the game, you need a group of people who are willing to meet on a semi-regular basis for about 3-4 hours. You also need
				someone to run the game: the storyteller. From now on, we'll refer to the storyteller as the dungeon master, or DM. If you’re reading this and
				you don’t know who your DM is, it’s probably you. <i>Be the DM you wish to see in the world.</i>
			</p>

	);
}

function SectionSessionZero() {
	return (
		<Section name={info.sections[0]}>
			<p>
				Once you have a group of friends and a DM, you should have a session zero. Session zero doesn’t have to be in-person; it can be a few text
				messages exchanged over the course of a few days. What matters is that everyone voices their expectations and ensures that they are compatible
				with their group before the first session.
			</p>
			<p>Here are some important questions to discuss:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>What type of game do you want to play?</b>
					<br />
					Does your group want a lot of combat, a lot of story, or a mix of both? Do they want a main quest with a primary villain, or a sandbox world
					with a lot sidequests? Are problems like bandits in the countryside or necromancer cults part of an oncoming apocalypse, or merely
					business-as-usual? Having a single epic main quest can be fun, but the constant urgency tends to reduce player freedom. On the other hand,
					sandbox campaigns may feel unfocused and purposeless.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Can player characters permanently die?</b>
					<br />
					Discuss player character death and total party kill (TPK) expectations. Are either of these outcomes possible? On the one hand, it can be
					heartbreaking to part with a beloved character. On the other hand, the possibility of player death leads to some extremely high stakes.
					Having the story end on a TPK is a very sour note; I think it is better for circumstances to intervene. However, having the possibility of
					true defeat does increase the authenticity of the threats.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>How do your characters meet?</b>
					<br />A tavern meeting is tried-and-true, but there are other options. Perhaps they’ve been enlisted by a local lord, jarl, or ealdorman to
					pursue some quest. Or maybe they've recently escaped from prison together, in which case one wonders whether they were falsely convicted, or
					are true scoundrels. Another possibility is that they were abducted and have awakened inside a labyrinth or cultist lair. Also, are any of
					the party natives to the starting area, or are they all foreigners? Can the players choose any race they want from the standard races list,
					or does the DM wish to create custom races to match a specific setting?
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>What is the tone of the story?</b>
					<br />
					Do you want the story to be comedic, epic, grimdark, or realistic? How comfortable is your group with fantasy violence, sexuality, or
					politics? Oftentimes racism and sexism can make unsavory characters more compelling, but they may make some people in the group
					uncomfortable. Likewise, excessive humor at the wrong moments can ruin heart pounding moments of tension or suffocating dread.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Are there any other concerns?</b>
					<br />
					For example, is player-versus-player combat allowed? (Not recommended.) Is this everyone’s first time playing the game, or is this a group
					of experienced players? Do you want to start at level 1, or higher?
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Once your group answers these questions, you’re ready to make your characters and start playing the game. Remember that most of these
				questions don’t have wrong answers—you can play whatever game you want to play.

function SectionGameCycle() {
	return (
		<Section name={info.sections[1]}>
			<p>
				The game cycles between three states: narration, questioning, and action. During narration, the DM describes a situation, scene, or setting.
				At some point, the DM introduces one or more hooks that invite player interaction. For example, a suspicious NPC, a quest board at a tavern, a
				hallway branching into several mysterious passages, or even a crime being comitted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Questioning happens after narration is complete, but before player have decided how they wish to respond. Players are usually trying to
				visualize the scene, probe for clues or hooks, or ask questions pertinent to their planned actions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once questioning is complete, the game moves into the action phase as the players tell the DM what they do. Sometimes, the DM simply narrates
				the outcome of these actions, completing the cycle. Other times, the action phase continues as the DM initiates either an event roll or a
				combat sequence.
			</p>
		</Section>
	);
}

function SectionEventRolls() {
	return (
		<Section name={info.sections[2]}>
			<p>
				An event roll happens when the DM determines that the outcome of some player's action depends on chance, usually related to the capabilities
				of their character. To perform an event roll, the DM first determines which aspect of the character will be tested, usually an attribute or a
				skill. An attribute check tests the raw abilities of a character, such as moving a heavy statue or sprinting quickly, while a skill check
				tests more applied abilities which may be improved through training, such as aiming a bow or haggling with a merchant.
			</p>
			<p>
				The DM then asks the player to roll for that skill, while privately determining a difficulty threshold (DT) typically ranging from 1 to 20. In
				response, the player rolls a d20 and adds their associated attribute score modifier. If the sum is greater than or equal to the DT, the
				character’s action succeeds.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes, an event roll determines whether the player can successfully react to and mitigate an impending disaster, rather than proactively
				accomplishing some feat. This type of event roll is often called a <i>saving throw</i>, but is otherwise treated the same as an ordinary event
				roll.
			</p>
			<p style={{marginLeft: "25px"}}>
				Note: By tradition, rolling a 1 on a d20 is called a critical fail and results in an unusually bad outcome. Conversely, rolling a 20 is called
				a natural 20 and usually results in instant success.
			</p>
			<p>
				If an event roll should have more than one potential outcome, the DM can add additional DT. For example, if the player is attempting to treat
				a wound, they may be asked to roll for medicine. The DM may decide that passing DT 12 indicates that the player is able to fully clean the
				wound and stanch the bleeding. Below 12 but above 6, and the wound is treated but later develops an infection. In any case, the DM does not
				usually disclose what the difficulty threshold(s) are—only the outcome.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the event roll is complete, the DM describes what has changed or transpired, returning to the narration phase and completing the cycle.

				Throughout the handbook, certain words have specific meanings. In other places, abbreviations are used to improve readability. Many of these

			<Glossary />
			<p>
				Dice are abbreviated by a "d" followed by the number of sides on the die. For example, "d6" refers to an ordinary cubic die. Abbreviations
				like "2d10" mean to roll a ten sided die twice and add the result together.

				Note: DC can easily be confused with difficulty class, which is used in other games and often abbreviated DC. Difficulty Class is called
				"Decision Threshold" in <i>All That Glitters</i>.
